## Formatting Rules
How to format your guides. If at any point you do not understand the formatting rules, take a look at other guides for inspiration.<br>
1. Start each step with a verb like `Clicked`, `Entered`, `Selected`, or `Pressed`<br><br>
2. Buttons - **Bolded**<br>
Example: Clicked **Button 1**<br><br>
3. Options - *Italicized*<br>
Example: Clicked *Option 1*<br><br>
4. Text to input - `inline code`<br>
Example: Typed `Some text here`<br><br>
5. You may use pipes `|` to chain similar actions excluding typing<br>
Example: Clicked **Button 1** | **Button 2** | *Option 1*<br><br>
6. A short explanation before each group of steps (recommended 3-25 per group) is helpful but optional.
